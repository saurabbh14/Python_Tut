        "Modern computers and the processing units on it (the parts that actually do the calculations, e. g. a central processing unit (CPU) in a personal computer) operates with a small set of instructions on how to work with bits and bytes (arrays of bits). So, the computer needs instructions in form of these commands. This so-called machine code is typically not human-readable. This is where programming languages come into play. \n",

        "Generally, there are two types of programming languages:\n",
        "- Compiled languages (such as Fortran, C, C++, Haskell): Here, a compiler program is required to translate the code to machine-readable information. The compiler generates a file that then can be executed. After each change in the code the compiler has to be re-run and the executable updated.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Interpreted languages (such as Python, Matlab, JavaScript): Here, instead of having a compiler generating an executable, an interpreter is used which dynamically (in the moment of reading the code) generates the machine-code instructions. Upon changing the code, the interpreter is restarted and the new program is run directly. \n",

        "Python, in a nutshell, can be used as a pretty powerful calculator. To start,  the **standard math operators** `+`, `-`, `/` and `*` are available. Raising one number to the power of another requires the `**` operator. Typically, as soon as one of the operands is a `float`, the result will also be a `float`. If and only if you operate on two `int` values, you will get an `int` back. \n",

        "\n",
        "For division of `int`s, there is a special operator, the **floor division** `//`, it works only on `int`s. *Try to use the `//` operator on `float` what do you notice?* In addition to the floor division operator `//`, there is also a modulus operator `%` that returns the remainder of a floor division.\n",

        "Apart from the standard operators, there are a **large number of pre-defined math functions** such as `exp()`, `sin()`, `cos()`, and many more. All you need to do to use them is write `import math` before your code and then use the functions as, e. g., `math.exp()`. We will discuss what that all means later in our course.\n",
